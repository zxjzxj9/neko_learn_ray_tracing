# Big Neko Learns Ray Tracing


This is a tutorial project created by a big cat (me) in order to learn ray tracing.

## **Chapter 0.** How to create a figure.

This library is in RenderLib, with function to create a binary .ppm(P6) format. Following is an example of library generated by RenderLib. This is a circle in the square, with 256x256 pixel. This lib will be the basis of following ray tracing code.

## **Chapter 1.** How to render a sphere.

First we need to build a background imag, the background is gradually changing from blue to white, which looks like follows (the image is *400 pixels* height x *800 pixels* width).

Now that we have the background image, we can draw a sphere on the basis of it. The equation to describe a sphere looks like follows. $ (x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 + (z-z_c)^2 = r^2 $, where $ (x_c, y_c, z_c) $ being the coordinate of sphere cneter, and $r$ being the radius of sphere. A ray is a straight line, so it shall have the equestion of $ r = r_0 + \mathbf{v} \cdot t$, where $r = (x, y, z)$, $r_0$ is the starting point of the ray, $\mathbf{v}$ is the direction of the ray and $t$ a parameter describing the running of points on the straight line. With the two equations, it can be easily found that $t$ should satisfy: $(r_0-r_c)^2 +2(r_0-r_c)\cdot \mathbf{v} \cdot t + v^2 * t^2 = r^2$, by constraining $v^2=1$.
